Description: We envision building a platform to connect past and present students from the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp together through a simple site that allows students to connect with fellow students, see upcoming events and view potential job opportunities.

- Your Network
	- Students can sign up for their own account and view contact information for fellow students in the network.
- Jobs
	- Students can post and see other job opportunities posted by fellow past and present students. 
- Events
	-  A plce where students can add and view upcoming events open to anyone in the network
- Engagement
	- We plan to send out a transactional welcome email after the new user completes the form to welcome them to the community and give them insight into how to best use the site
We plan to send out a monthly email to provide updates to the network of users on upcoming events, new jobs added, etc.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Materialize, EJS, Javascript/jQuery, Node.JS, Express, SendGrid, mySQL. We also used the Body Parser, Cookie Parser and Method Override NPM packages.
